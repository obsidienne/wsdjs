""My love of music is only rivaled by my love of dancing. I really do spend countless hours seeking out new music to share with west coast swing dance community. I love to see a floor packed with dancers and playing music that makes people want to dance. My music sets contain a mixture of swing, blues, pop, r&b and more. I am truly honored to have been named the 2010 DJ of the Year by the AllSwing DJ group. I was also nominated for a WAG Award as 2010 DJ of the Year."" Currently member of the AllSwing DJs Group and Global Swing DJs Group, Ruby frequently DJ parties, dances, and competitions locally and nationally.";R&B;Luther Vandross;Purple;I love Cajun food;Dogs;2008;I love my family more than anything !;I hate being late :)
